    'category': 'Product',
    'description': """
-> This module slighly changes the product search function to allow multi words
search, usefull when you have a lot of products.
It uses the ":" as a separator. The order of the words you type doesn't matter.
For example, if you search "rice:ital:whit", it will find a product named
"white rice from italia 1kg"

When you install this module, all product names containing the separator will
be changed.
By default, the ':' in product names will be replaced by ''.
Those values can be changed in the model/product.py, with the _SEPARATOR and
_REPLACEMENT constants.

-> This module also provides unaccent search against the products. To activate
this, you have to:
- install postgresql-contrib package (sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib)
- run this request as a superuser on the db you use:
        CREATE EXTENSION unaccent;
- restart your OE server with --unaccent option
